Exercise: Number Guessing Game

Description:
Create a number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. The program should provide feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.

Instructions:
1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100 and store it in a variable.
2. Prompt the user to enter a number as their guess.
3. Compare the user's guess with the randomly generated number.
4. If the guess is correct, display a congratulatory message and end the game.
5. If the guess is too high, display a message indicating that the guess is too high and prompt the user for another guess.
6. If the guess is too low, display a message indicating that the guess is too low and prompt the user for another guess.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the user guesses the correct number.
8. When the game ends, display the total number of guesses it took the user to find the correct answer.

Example Output:
```
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I have chosen a random number between 1 and 100.
Can you guess the number?

Enter your guess: 50
Too high! Try again.

Enter your guess: 25
Too low! Try again.

Enter your guess: 35
Too high! Try again.

Enter your guess: 30
Congratulations! You guessed the correct number in 4 attempts.
```

Note: You can use the `Math.random()` function to generate a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). To convert it to a number between 1 and 100, you can multiply it by 100 and then use `Math.floor()` to round it down to the nearest whole number.
